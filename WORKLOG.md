5/19/2023 | Started researching possible implementations of resizing a window in processing. Looked at documentation for `size()`, `setResizeable()`, `windowResizeable()`, and `windowResize()`. Also found that processing has a `filter()` method to show an image through various modes. The processing function `mask()` can load another image and use it as an alpha channel, which would be useful for various color filters.| Started working on the opening window. Researched how to use `selectInput()` to select the image file for use.
5/22/23 | Cloned stuff from old repo to this one (copied stuff into README and WORKLOG and committed code from the past two days). Added code to `draw()` to show the background of filter window.| Sucessfully figured out how to use `selectInput()` to display a chosen image file. Worked on text and sizing for opening window. Used `mouseclicked()` to call `selectInput()` function.
5/23/23 | Merge main to my branch and copied Christina's button implementation over to my code to put my previous draw function under one of the button's conditions. Changed position of image display after chosen to be on the right part of the screen with a 10pxl border. Altered `mouseClicked()` to allow implementation of buttons by checking `mouseY()` and making `num_of_filts` a global variable.| Added a button to select a file and changed window displays.
5/24/23 | Just fixed small typos on worklog and fixed minor merge errors on my branch. | Looked up how bits changed in stegSolve.
5/25/23 | Started making homework. Used ibisPaint to make 700x700 pixel images with black and white pixels to hide flags. Made Python function that hides the image on red color plane.| Added to `mouseclicked()` function and created `fil()` function to modify red bits.
5/30/23 | Continued trying to make the homework files. Not much progress since no wifi from 5/27 | Made planes for all eight ARGB bits
5/31/23 | Found a website to hide b/w images inside of color planes of another image. https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload Created b/w images for the homeworks and hid them in normal images found in the IMAGES directory. Made questions 0-4 of homework and updated HOMEWORK.md. Also did a lot in PRESENTATION.md. Also used the code I was trying to debug from the past few days to make an example of bad image hiding in the presentation file. | Tested homework examples and worked on color inversion
6/1/23 | | Finished xor and full color planes
