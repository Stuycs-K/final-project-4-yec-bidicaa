5/19/2023 | Started researching possilbe implementations of resizing a window in processing. Looked at documentation for `size()`, `setResizeable()`, `windowResizeable()`, and `windowResize()`. Also found that processing has a `filter()` method to show an image through various modes. The processing function `mask()` can load another image and use it as an alpha channel, which would be useful for various color filters.| Started working on the opening window. Researched how to use selectInput() to select the image file for use.
