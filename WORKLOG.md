5/19/2023 | Started researching possible implementations of resizing a window in processing. Looked at documentation for `size()`, `setResizeable()`, `windowResizeable()`, and `windowResize()`. Also found that processing has a `filter()` method to show an image through various modes. The processing function `mask()` can load another image and use it as an alpha channel, which would be useful for various color filters.| Started working on the opening window. Researched how to use `selectInput()` to select the image file for use.
5/22/23 | Cloned stuff from old repo to this one (copied stuff into README and WORKLOG and committed code from the past two days). Added code to `draw()` to show the background of filter window.| Sucessfully figured out how to use `selectInput()` to display a chosen image file. Worked on text and sizing for opening window. Used `mouseclicked()` to call `selectInput()` function.
5/23/23 | Merge main to my branch and copied Christina's button implementation over to my code to put my previous draw function under one of the button's conditions. Changed position of image display after chosen to be on the right part of the screen with a 10pxl border. Altered `mouseClicked()` to allow implementation of buttons by checking `mouseY()` and making `num_of_filts` a global variable.| Added a button to select a file and changed window displays.
5/24/23 | Just fixed small typos on worklog and fixed minor merge errors on my branch. |
