Final project repository for Pd04 Cybersecurity

## Project Description
This is a recreation of most of stegsolve's features. 

Here's what we've covered (in order of appearance):
- Color inversion (xor)
- Alpha bit planes
- RBG bit planes
- full Alpha plane
- RGB color planes

## Usage
To use this, clone our github repository and open `steg.pde` in processing. Then run the file.

When you first run the program, you will have to click on the button in the middle of the window to open a file explorer to choose an image to look at. The steg directory in our repository has an example image, `cat.jpg`, for you to get started. Then, you can go between different bit planes to view the image.

Note: For best results, use images less than 750x750 pixels in size. If your image is larger than that, only the top left corner (750x750 pixels) of the image will show. Your picture may overlap with the buttons on the window if it's towards the larger side, but you can still click the buttons.
