# 4.YeC.BidicaA
Final Project Repo for Pd4 Cyber

## Project Description
This is a recreation of most of stegsolve's features. 
Some of the planes we will cover are:
+ Different color filters, such as showing only the pixels with red, green, or blue values.
+ Showing only pixels with a certain rgba value.
+ (and more)

## Usage
To use this, clone our github repository and open `steg.pde` in processing. Then run the file.

When you first run the program, you will have to click on the button in the middle of the window to open a file explorer to choose an image to look at. The steg directory in our repository has an example image, `cat.jpg`, for you to get started. Then, you can go between different bit planes to view the image.
