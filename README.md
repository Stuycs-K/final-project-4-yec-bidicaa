# 4.YeC.BidicaA
Final Project Repo for Pd4 Cyber

## Project Description
This is a recreation of most of stegsolve's features. 
Some of the planes we will cover are:
+ Different color filters, such as showing only the pixels with red, green, or blue values.
+ Showing only pixels with a certain rgba value.
+ (and more)

## Usage (Draft)
You need to run this in processing.

When running the program in processing, the user will be prompted to type the name of the image they would like to use. Then, the user can select which color filter to use from a list of options. If the filter requires any input, the user can type it in before looking at the filter.
